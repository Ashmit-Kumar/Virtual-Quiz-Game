This is the project which I made during the 3rd semester of my B.Tech days. 
This is a Virtual Quiz Game developed in Python by using libraries like OpenCV and Mediapipe.
The questions for the game are stored in a MySQL server and we fetch it using mysql.connector library.


Let's first check out the website first
